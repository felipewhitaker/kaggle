# Kaggle

This is a collection of the projects I coded while studying. My main interests are Data Science and Machine Learning, and thus I will be studying about Data Visualization, Statistical frameworks for modelling, Deep Learning Frameworks and everything about data pipelines. 

During the writting of this README, the world is living one of the worst health crisis of the last hundred years - so I am mainly studying free content through the internet. I might add links and references.

Right now things as not as organized as I would like them to be - or it might be mostly empty - but it's where I will push things and will be updating from time to time.
